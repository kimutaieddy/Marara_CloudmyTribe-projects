# Your Cloud Resume: Host Your Static Website on AWS

This project involves hosting a static resume website on AWS. The website is a resume written in HTML.

## Getting Started

### Step-by-Step Guide 

#### 1. Review the Challenge Requirements
Thoroughly read through the requirements of the challenge to understand the expectations and goals. The outcome of this step should be a clear understanding of the objectives and deliverables.

#### 2. Explore AWS Documentation
Dive into AWS documentation to familiarize yourself with the services needed for this challenge. Focus on:
  - Amazon S3 (for static website hosting)
  - AWS CloudFront (for CDN)
  - Route 53 (for DNS management)
  - IAM (for access management)
The outcome of this step should be knowledge of the services you'll be using, including best practices and configurations.

#### 3. Build Your Architecture Diagram
Design an architecture diagram that outlines the structure of your static website hosting solution. Use tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or any diagramming tool you're comfortable with. Include components like S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, Route 53, and IAM roles/policies. The outcome of this step should be a comprehensive architecture diagram that visually represents the infrastructure.

#### 4. HTML
Your resume needs to be written in [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML). Not a Word doc, not a PDF. You can find an example [here](https://codepen.io/emzarts/pen/OXzmym).
